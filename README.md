Zipf’s Law &amp; Benford’s Law in Text Processing


Zipf’s Law and Text Processing

This project is based on the text from Charles Darwin’s book, with approximately 1 million ASCII characters (~160,000 words). You will perform preprocessing and analyze its word frequency distribution.

Preprocessing Steps:
1. Convert all letters to uppercase.
2. Remove all non-alphabetic characters, except spaces (punctuation marks such as commas, periods, and special symbols will be removed).
3. The text will consist of:
- 26 letters (A-Z)
- 10 digits (0-9)
- 4 additional symbols (total alphabet size: 40).

Objective:
Apply Zipf’s Law, which states that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank.
Extract each word from the processed text.

Generate a frequency table listing:
-
- Word
- Rank
- Frequency

Plot and Analysis:
Draw a log-log graph, where:
X-axis represents word rank.
Y-axis represents word frequency.
Analyze and interpret the graph.
Question: Does the text follow Zipf’s Law?
